### Questions:
The lifetime of a particular type of TV follows a normal distribution with mu(mean) =4800 hours, and sigma(standard deviation)=400 hours. 

(a) Find the probability that a single randomly-chosen TV will last less than 4,500 
hours. Use R to assist with your computations.

(b) Find the probability that the mean lifetime of a random sample of 16 TVs is
less than 4,500 hours. Use R to assist with your computations.

(c) Compare answers from (a) and (b).

```{r}
# create random normal distribution of 10,000 hours of TV using mean and sd 
TV <- rnorm(10000, 4800, 400)
pTV <- pnorm(4499, 4800, 400)
plot(density(TV))
abline(v=4499)
```
